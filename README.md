# Binary Converter for Developer

This is a google translate clone. But you can convert text to binary, text to decimal, binary to octal and more. I hope this web app can help developers to convert a type of number to another type easily.

## Setup

I recommend you to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to run this project on your local computer. If you haven't installed it, you can follow the following commands:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g pnpm

# homebrew
brew install pnpm
```

Go to this project directory and make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm preview
```
